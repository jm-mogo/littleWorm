Being bored and without an internet connection led me to create this game. 
At first, I didn't know what to do. I wasn't even creating a game; I just wrote a function that created a div, with a bunch of divs inside.
I styled the divs with borders, and it looked like an old pixel game.
So, I came up with the idea of creating a game with the coding skills I had at the moment.
