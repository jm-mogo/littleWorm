Being bored, and withour internet connection lead me to create this game.
First I didn't know what to do, I wasn't even creating a game, I just wrote a function that created a div, with a bunch of divs inside. 
I style the divs with borders, and it look like an old pixel game.
So, I came up with the idea of creating a game with the coding skills I had at the moment.
